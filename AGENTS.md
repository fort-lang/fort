# fort
A safe(r) C-like systems programming language.

## Naming
- The language is `fort`. Source files use the extension `.ft`. The compiler binary is `fort`.

## Project Layout
- `notes/`: the language specification. `notes/decisions.md` (numbered decision log) and
  `notes/grammar.md` are normative and win over every other document. Start at
  `notes/project-overview.md`.
- `test/`: `test/test.h` is the C macro framework for the compiler's unit tests
  (`test/common.h` provides `TEST_UNUSED`); `test/lang/` holds language tests in the directive
  format defined in `notes/toolchain.md`.
- `src/bootstrap/`: the C bootstrap compiler (stage1), frozen once the compiler is self-hosted.
  `src/fort/`: the compiler written in fort (stage2 and stage3). `runtime/`: the C runtime
  linked into every program. `std/`: the standard library in fort. `tools/`: `vm`,
  `provision.sh`, `lines.py`, `bootstrap.sh`.
- `editors/`: `editors/vscode/` is the VS Code extension (`package.json`,
  `language-configuration.json`, `syntaxes/fort.tmLanguage.json`) and `editors/README.md` is its
  install guide and its list of limitations.
- `CMakeLists.txt`, `CMakePresets.json` and `cmake/sanitizers.cmake` are the build;
  `.clang-format` and `.clang-tidy` (clang 18) are the C11 lint configuration.
- `.tickets/` (gitignored, main checkout only) is the ticket board; `.claude/agents/` holds the
  `implementor` and `reviewer` agent definitions.

## Environment
- Everything builds and runs inside the Ubuntu 24.04 arm64 Vagrant VM defined by `Vagrantfile`
  (VirtualBox, `bento/ubuntu-24.04`); nothing is built on the host. Run vagrant only through
  `tools/vm`: `up` creates, provisions and starts the VM and caches its ssh config; `halt` stops
  it; `destroy [-f]` removes it (the box stays installed); `provision` re-runs
  `tools/provision.sh`; `status` and `ssh` do what they say.
- The VM directory (whose `Vagrantfile` and `.vagrant/` are used) is `$FORT_VM_DIR` if set,
  otherwise the main checkout of the current repository, so every worktree shares one VM. It is
  `/vagrant` in the guest and worktrees are `/vagrant/.worktrees/<name>`. The VirtualBox machine
  is named `fort-dev-<directory name>` (`fort-dev-fort` for the main checkout), so a VM brought
  up from another directory does not collide with it; destroy one before bringing up the other
  if memory is tight. `FORT_VM_CPUS` (default 6) and `FORT_VM_MEMORY` (MiB, default 8192) size
  the VM at `up`.
- `tools/vm run <cmd>` executes in the guest directory matching the host cwd, which must lie
  inside the VM directory (`ssh` and the cmake subcommands too; the lifecycle subcommands work
  from anywhere inside the repository, or anywhere with `FORT_VM_DIR` set). The cmake
  subcommands (`configure`, `build`, `test`, `workflow`, the targets below and `gate`) run at
  the top of the host git worktree containing the cwd and default to the `debug` preset. Every
  guest command sources `/etc/profile.d/fort.sh` and disables core dumps.
- When the Mac sleeps, VirtualBox pauses the VM ("paused due to host power management") and
  `tools/vm status` shows `paused`; guest commands then fail after the 10 s ssh timeout and
  `tools/vm up` cannot resume it. Recover with `VBoxManage controlvm fort-dev-<name> savestate`
  followed by `tools/vm up`.
- The shared folder can serve stale pages to tools that `mmap` a file the host rewrote (seen
  with `clang-format` reporting a line past the end of a shrunk file while `md5sum` read the
  right bytes). Recover with `tools/vm run 'sync; sudo sh -c "echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"'`.
- The target is x86-64 Linux. The compiler runs natively on arm64, emits LLVM IR and runs `clang
  --target=x86_64-linux-gnu` over it, so `--cc` names a clang (the guest `cc` is a native gcc and
  would build for aarch64); generated programs run under `qemu-x86_64` transparently. The verified
  line is in `notes/toolchain.md` 2 (D14.3), and `--target` names the triple (D14.1). Provisioning
  sets `QEMU_LD_PREFIX`; the test harness sets it itself. When a cross program dies by a signal,
  qemu-user appends `qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped` to the program's
  stderr; native execution prints nothing, so a harness comparing stderr drops that line
  (`test/pipeline_test.sh` and `test/lang/run_tests.py` do).
- Provisioning disables apport and sets `kernel.core_pattern=core`: Ubuntu's piped core pattern
  ignores `ulimit -c 0` and made every SIGABRT cost about a second. A VM provisioned before that
  change needs `tools/vm provision` once (or the same two commands by hand).
- git runs on the host; it also works in the guest: provisioning symlinks the host path of the
  VM directory to `/vagrant`, so worktree `.git` files (absolute host paths) resolve there.

## Build and test
- Presets (`CMakePresets.json`, Ninja, clang unless noted): `debug`, `release` (RelWithDebInfo),
  `gcc`, `asan`, `msan`, `tsan`, `ubsan` (the last four set `FORT_SANITIZER` for
  `cmake/sanitizers.cmake`, which instruments every native target but never the cross-compiled
  runtime object). `tools/vm workflow <preset>` configures, builds and runs ctest; build
  directories are `build/<preset>` inside the worktree. `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror
  -Wshadow -Wvla -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes -Wundef` apply to every C target.
- Targets: `fort_core` (static library, `src/bootstrap/*.c` except `main.c`, globbed), `fort`
  (`build/<preset>/fort`), `fort_rt` (`runtime/fort_rt.c` cross-compiled by `FORT_TARGET_CC`,
  a clang (default `clang`) with `--target=${FORT_TARGET_TRIPLE}` (default
  `x86_64-linux-gnu`), into `build/<preset>/std/fort_rt.o` next to a copy of
  `std/*.ft`), `fort_rt_native` (the runtime compiled natively with `-DFORT_RT_NO_MAIN` for the
  unit tests and tidy), `lang_ffi_helpers` (`test/lang/ffi/*.c` built natively so `-Werror` and
  tidy cover them), `check` (ctest label `unit`, including `lang_lint` and `lang_selftest`),
  `check-lang` (`test/lang/run_tests.py` with the built compiler; the same command is the ctest
  `lang`, label `lang`), `check-all` (both), `format` and `format-check` (clang-format
  over `src`, `runtime`, `test`), `check-comments` (`tools/check_comments.py`, which
  `format-check` depends on: it rejects a `/* */` in the same sources, D2.2, and its own unit
  tests are the ctest `check_comments_selftest`), `tidy` (`run-clang-tidy` over the same),
  `lines` (`tools/lines.py`: test lines per compiler line, target 3:1, `--min RATIO` fails
  below it; `--since REF` measures a branch's own diff instead of the whole repository, which
  is how a ticket answers for the code it introduces rather than hiding behind the corpus
  already there; its own tests are the ctest `lines_selftest`).
  `tools/vm <target> [preset]` runs one.
- A CMake variable derived from a cache variable must not be cached itself: `find_program`
  caches by default, so `FORT_TARGET_CC_PATH` kept resolving to the old program after
  `FORT_TARGET_CC` changed in an existing build directory, and the build then ran gcc with
  clang's arguments. It uses `NO_CACHE`; check for the same trap before adding a `find_program`
  or `find_file` whose `NAMES` come from a cache variable, or delete `build/<preset>` after such
  a change.
- `tools/vm gate` is the merge gate: `format-check`, `tidy`, and `check-all` under `debug`,
  `asan` and `ubsan` (it configures `debug` first, then configures and builds each preset before
  its `check-all`).
- Language tests: `test/lang/run_tests.py [filter]` (decisions D14.4, D14.5; toolchain.md 7.3
  describes every option and verdict). `test/lang/xfail.txt` lists tests the compiler cannot
  pass yet; a listed test that passes fails the run, so shrink the list in the same commit that
  makes tests pass. `test/lang/bootstrap-unsupported.txt` lists tests that use features the C
  bootstrap deliberately lacks (floats, multi-dimensional arrays, do-while, `?:`; function
  pointers are in its subset, D3.10); keep such features out of core tests, or split them into
  their own test, so the core tests exercise stage1. `run_tests.py --lint` validates directives
  without a compiler and runs before every test run; `run_tests.py --check-json` is a mode of its
  own (ctest `lang_check_json`, also run by check-lang) that holds the document of `fort --check
  --json` against the text form on every fail test and ignores `xfail.txt`, since it judges the
  two forms of one run rather than the test. It also selects a test with an `index.json` beside
  it, runs that one with `--index` and holds its `"symbols"` against the file byte for byte
  (D20.3): the golden is one record per line as `render_index` spells it, it is the one non-`.ft`
  file a directory test may hold, and `--lint` checks its shape without a compiler, so a golden
  edited by hand into another spelling of the same records fails the lint rather than the run.
  Regenerate one with `fort --index` and `render_index`, never by hand. A compiler exit status
  other than 0 or 1 is an `ERROR`, which `xfail.txt` still covers. The harness and its unit tests
  are Python 3.12, standard library only, wrapped at 100 columns (the host's
  `ruff format --line-length 100` is the reference); `run_tests_test.py` scripts a fake `fort`
  with `//@` lines, extend it rather than calling the real compiler.
- Unit tests: `test/<component>_test.c` with `test/test.h`; every `test/*_test.c` is globbed
  into an executable `build/<preset>/test/<component>_test` linked against `fort_core` and
  `fort_rt_native`, and a ctest `unit-<component>`. A `TEST` body is one macro argument: a comma
  outside parentheses (a brace initializer, for example) splits it. `#val` in an assertion
  message is the argument after macro expansion, so compare through a variable when the
  expected text matters. Suites are ordinary C11: no `__VA_OPT__`, and `-Wtype-limits` (gcc)
  rejects assertions that are always true, such as `TEST_ASSERT_GE_SIZE(n, 0)`. The
  `TEST_ASSERT_*_INT64`/`_SIZE` operands are printed with `PRId64`/`%zu`, so cast plain
  literals and `long` values (`(int64_t)0`) or `-Wformat` fails the build. A suite whose
  literals are the test data (sample values, expected texts) wraps them in
  `// NOLINTBEGIN(readability-magic-numbers)` with a comment saying so rather than naming each.
  The sanitizer presets run the unit tests with `allocator_may_return_null=1` (ctest sets the
  environment, `cmake/sanitizers.cmake`) because the runtime's out-of-memory path is tested with
  an impossible allocation; run a suite by hand under those presets with the same variable.
- A test that must observe a program the compiler spawns uses a fake one: `test/fake_cc.sh` is
  the `--cc` of `driver_test`, it writes its own path and every argument, one per line, into
  `$FORT_FAKE_CC_LOG` and exits with `$FORT_FAKE_CC_STATUS`, so the whole clang command line is
  one string comparison and the failure path is a variable away. CMake passes its path as
  `FORT_FAKE_CC` to that one target (a `target_compile_definitions` after the glob loop), since
  a unit test has no working directory it can rely on.
- The TextMate grammar is checked by `test/highlight_test.py` (ctest `highlight_selftest`, label
  `unit`, run from `test/`): it reads the D2.4 keyword lists and the D2.10 operator list out of
  `notes/decisions.md` and the same sets out of the grammar, so the two cannot drift. That only
  works while the rules keep their canonical shapes, `\b(?:a|b)\b` for keywords and `(?:\+|-)`
  for operators; a rule whose scope is in a keyword or operator family but whose pattern matches
  neither shape fails the test. Its other half is a small TextMate engine that asserts the scopes
  of `test/highlight/scopes.ft` (`//^` lines: alternating text and scope fields naming what the
  line above must produce), of the D5.3 and D17.2 marker tables, and of every `test/lang/run`
  test, which must tokenize with no `invalid.` scope and no unscoped character, so a new language
  test that the grammar mishandles fails here.
- The cross pipeline: `test/ir/*.ll` are hand-written LLVM 18 modules in the form
  `notes/toolchain.md` 6 specifies (D19.1); its two worked examples are these files byte for
  byte, so a change to one changes the other. `test/pipeline_test.sh <build-dir>`
  verifies each with `opt-18 -passes=verify`, compiles and links it with `clang
  --target=x86_64-linux-gnu` and `<build-dir>/std/fort_rt.o`, runs it under qemu and checks
  stdout, stderr and the status byte-exactly; ctest `pipeline` (label `unit`). `*.ll` is
  gitignored except `test/ir/*.ll`. `run_tests.py --verify-ir` runs the same verifier over the
  `-S` output of every language test that compiles.
- Test code that is compiled rather than included lives in a `test/*.c` that is not a suite
  (`test/ast_dump.c`, the syntax tree's S-expression printer): CMake globs every such file into
  the `fort_test_support` object library and links it into every suite, so `-Werror` and
  clang-tidy cover it once. A suite links `fort_core`, so a helper may not take the name of a
  compiler function (`type_error` is types.h's error-type constructor, not a test helper).
- clang-tidy's `readability-function-size` caps `main` at about 60 `TEST_RUN`s (statement
  threshold 800; each `TEST_RUN` expands to about 13 statements, so 89 measured 1162): split a
  larger suite into two files with a shared `test/<component>_helpers.h` whose helpers are
  `static inline` so that a suite using only some of them still builds under `-Werror`.
  `test/fork.h` runs a function in a forked child and captures its stderr and exit status, for
  paths that end the process (`fatal_oom`); under asan the child runs LeakSanitizer at exit, so
  the forked function must not drop a block it allocated (blocks its still-live frames point to
  are reachable and fine).
- `TEST_ASSERT_TRUE(f())` and `TEST_ASSERT_FALSE(f())` evaluate their argument twice when it
  fails, once for the test and once for the `#val` of the message, so a call with side effects
  runs a second time on the failing path only. Keep it: it caught a checker that could not run
  twice over one tree. A helper whose second run must not differ either stores the result in a
  variable first or is made idempotent.
- clang-tidy's `readability-inconsistent-declaration-parameter-name` fires only under
  `tools/vm tidy`, late in the loop: when a definition renames a parameter, for instance to stop
  it shadowing a new file-scope static, rename it in the header too, in the same edit.
- Running `run-clang-tidy` by hand: its positional arguments are regexes matched against the
  absolute paths in `compile_commands.json`, so a relative path such as `../../test` silently
  selects nothing and reports success. Use `tools/vm tidy` or absolute guest paths.
- Binaries: `build/<preset>/fort` is stage1 (the C compiler); `build/<preset>/stage2/fort` and
  `stage3/fort` are the self-hosted compiler built by stage1 and by stage2.

## Technical Standards
- **Markdown**: Line-wrap at 100 characters, including tables and code blocks. Check with
  `awk 'length > 100 {print FILENAME": "FNR}' <files>`. Code fences use `fort`, `c`, `sh`,
  `llvm`, `json` or `ebnf` as the language tag.
- **Language changes**: any change to the language is recorded in `notes/decisions.md` first
  (new decision number or amended decision with a note), then in the specification document that
  owns the topic, then in the tests under `test/lang/`. Specification text never contains "TBD",
  "pending" or "not finalized"; deferred features live only in decision D15.
- **Renaming a term**: sweep the stem, not the word. `grep -rni slice` never matches "Slicing",
  so a rename of `slice` to `span` must sweep `slic` (and any other inflected stem) with
  `grep -rni` before the criterion is ticked; markdown width is not covered by the gate, so run the
  `awk 'length > 100'` check over every file touched.
- **"span" names the fort type `T@`** (D3.5), so a byte or source extent is a **range** everywhere
  in the compiler: `str_from_range`, token byte ranges, `ASSERT_TOK_RANGE`, and `loc_t` ranges in
  the editor-support work. Never call an extent a span.
- **Checker annotations**: `type`, `sym`, `aux` and the `CHECK_ANN_*` bits of `ann` belong to
  the checker (`check.h`); `check_module` clears them before it writes them, so checking one
  module twice starts from the tree the parser left rather than reading symbols of a checker
  that is gone. `aux` indexes the checker's own value vector on a constant node and holds a
  field's byte offset on a field declaration, so it is never read without the bit that says
  which it is.
- **Node ranges**: a node's `loc` is a range (D20.4). A parser function ends a node's range with
  `finish(p, n)` at every successful return in which it consumed the node's trailing tokens: the
  nodes it built itself, and also a node a callee built whose `;` it consumed, as
  `parse_simple_statement` and `parse_var_decl` do. It leaves a node alone when the tokens it
  consumed are not part of it, as `parse_paren_expr` does with the `)` of a parenthesized
  expression, whose start cannot move over the `(` (D20.4). A name is recorded with
  `expect_name(p, n)`, and a node's start never moves: the nodes named after an operator still
  start at it (`toolchain.md` 4). `test/parser_range_test.c` catches a missed `finish` only when
  the node has a child that ends after the node's anchor token, since what it checks is that a
  child's range lies inside its parent's: dropping the `finish` of a childless node (`break`,
  `continue`), of a marker-only type suffix (`* mut`) or of a trailing `;` leaves it green. Those
  need an explicit `parser_loc_test` assertion on the source text the range covers. Add a new node
  kind to the corpus of the first suite and an assertion to the second.
- **Lexer recovery**: a lexical error costs the lexer its line, and the parser then recovers from
  whatever that missing line broke (D14.2) -- nothing when the line was a statement of its own,
  the enclosing construct when it carried a `{`, a `(` or a declaration header. `lex_file` reports
  the error, drops every token already lexed on that line, resumes at the start of the next one
  and keeps returning whether the file was clean, but the array it leaves always covers the rest
  of the file and ends in TOK_EOF, so `parse_module` runs on it whatever was reported and a caller
  asks whether the file is usable by comparing `diag_count()`. Dropping the line's earlier tokens
  is what keeps the parser from reporting a syntax error over the half construct that stood before
  the error, which the user never typed and cannot annotate: `test/lang/fail/lexical` is the test,
  since a diagnostic on an unannotated line fails the run (D14.5) and `parser_recovery_test.c`
  walks the same corpus. The cap of twenty diagnostics is the file's, not the parser's: `lex_file`
  opens it with `diag_begin_file()` and both report while `diag_file_count() < DIAG_MAX_PER_FILE`.
- **Parser recovery**: `p->failed` means "unwinding the construct a syntax error hit" (D14.2),
  not "the file is dead". Everything between the report and the next recovery point is silent, so
  a new parse function needs no error handling of its own: return NULL and the recovery point
  above it skips, records an `AST_ERROR` and clears `failed`. Two rules constrain a change there.
  A construct may return non-NULL with `failed` set -- `parse_block_tail`, `parse_switch`,
  `parse_struct_decl` and `parse_enum_decl` do when their `}` is missing -- and every caller must
  then propagate quietly, so a caller that tests `!= NULL` keeps working; the recovery point
  pushes that node and clears `failed` without skipping, since the construct already stands at
  the boundary. `spec_begin` clears `failed` and `spec_rewind` restores it, because a speculation
  answers about the tokens ahead and every speculation reads `failed` afterwards to tell a type
  that parsed from one that did not: a speculation made during an unwind, which is what a
  recovery point and the first statement of a body with no `{` do, would otherwise read the
  unwind and answer no. And every recovery must consume a token unless it is
  at the end of the file, or `parse_module` loops forever: `skip_to_boundary` bumps once when the
  construct consumed nothing. A skip counts the `(` and `[` the failed construct left open, from
  its first token, so the `;` of a `for` header or of an argument list is not mistaken for a
  statement boundary; it deliberately does not count a `{` it left open, since which brace that
  was is not decidable from the tokens and assuming the construct owns the next `}` eats the
  enclosing block's. Both braces of a body have a rule of their own: a body ends at a top-level
  keyword, and the `{` of a function, struct or enum body may be missing, because a declaration
  header is complete before it. `test/lang/fail` is the cascade test (`parser_recovery_test.c`
  walks it): a diagnostic on a line with no `//! error:` annotation fails the suite, and the
  diagnostic counts of the files with two syntax errors are asserted beside it, since a walk that
  only forbids unannotated lines also passes with recovery switched off.
- **Diagnostic records**: a `diag_record_t` owns its file name as well as its message. `loc.file`
  is borrowed from whoever reported the diagnostic -- the module set, whose pool holds every file
  name it read -- and that set is freed before `fort --check --json` writes its document (D20.2),
  so a record that kept the borrowed pointer hands out freed bytes. The symptom is not a crash:
  the freed block still held a NUL, so the document printed `"file":""` while the text form,
  written at report time, was right. `record_append` interns the name in the sink's own pool, and
  anything else a record must outlive its reporter for is copied the same way.
- **Reading a tree after the front end**: `driver_front_end` does not own the analysis. The
  module set (which owns every tree) and the checker (which owns every symbol and type the
  annotations point to) are a `driver_analysis_t` the caller prepares and frees, because a `sym`
  or `type` slot dangles the moment `check_free` runs (sym.h). A build frees it as soon as the
  front end returns; `--check --json` frees it after the document has been written, since the
  index walk of D20.3 reads the trees then. A new pass over an annotated tree goes in that
  window, not after it. A whole-closure pass also takes its order from `module_set_pass_at`
  (modules.h): the dependency order, then the modules the loader read but never ordered. The
  checker and the index walk share it because the index's file order is documented as the
  checker's order (D20.3), and two copies of that loop would drift with no test able to see it.
- **The IR emitter** (`src/bootstrap/gen*.c`, toolchain.md 6): it runs inside that window, before
  the caller frees the analysis, because every annotation it reads points into the checker
  (`check.h`); an emitter called after the analysis is released walks freed memory. It builds its
  operand and type texts in one shared `g->scratch`, so a function that has begun writing there
  must compute a nested text first and only then compose -- `nominal_type_name` and `enum_name`
  each call `gen_symbol`,
  which clears the same buffer, and both got `%struct.` and `@.enum.` silently dropped before the
  name was built first. A construct the emitter does not lower yet reports
  `cannot generate code yet for <what>` through `gen_todo` and fails the compilation: an unfinished
  path is a diagnostic, never wrong code, and the ticket that implements it deletes its `gen_todo`.
  The suites (`test/gen*_test.c` over `test/gen_helpers.h`) emit into a sandbox they `chdir` into,
  so `@.file.N` holds a bare file name and the text does not depend on the build directory; CMake
  passes them `FORT_OPT` and `FORT_IR_DIR`, and the ctest `lang` passes `--verify-ir`, so every
  module either suite produces is checked by `opt -passes=verify`.
- **Citing decisions in code**: a citation goes on the line or function that implements the
  rule, with a phrase stating the rule (`// pointers print as 0x + lowercase hex, 0x0 for null
  (D11.7)`), so a reader learns the rule without opening the log. A bare tag list at file or
  section level (`// Printing (D11.5, D11.7, D12.2).`) is not a citation.
- **Writing specification text**: cite the decision each rule implements as `(Dn.m)`. An agent
  that needs a rule the decision log does not settle uses the most conservative reading, marks it,
  and reports it to the lead for ratification; it never invents syntax or semantics. Every
  amendment to `notes/decisions.md` is relayed to agents still writing against the old text, and
  a separate audit pass reconciles the documents afterwards.
- **C sources**: C11 (`-std=c11`, `_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L`), no third-party code, warnings are
  errors under both clang (default) and gcc (`gcc` preset). `_POSIX_C_SOURCE` alone does not
  make glibc declare `environ`: `<unistd.h>` guards it with `#ifdef __USE_GNU`, so a file that
  passes an environment to `posix_spawn` declares `extern char** environ;` itself, as POSIX
  allows. `realpath` is the same case (`<stdlib.h>` guards it with `__USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED`, which
  `_POSIX_C_SOURCE` does not set), and `src/bootstrap/modules.c` declares it the same way;
  check for that guard before calling any POSIX function the headers seem to be missing, rather
  than widening the feature macros. Names: functions, variables, parameters, fields and
  struct/union/enum tags lower_case;
  typedefs lower_case with a `_t` suffix; enum constants, file-scope constants (static or not),
  function-scope static constants and macros UPPER_CASE (`enum { BYTE_MASK = 0xFFU }`); local
  constants lower_case; macros private to a header end with an underscore (`TEST_LOG_`). Every
  non-void call result is used or discarded with `(void)` (`TEST_UNUSED` in tests); no magic
  numbers (0 to 4, powers of two, `1.0` and `100.0` are allowed); uppercase literal suffixes;
  comments are `//` only, never `/* */`, as in fort (D2.2), so a region is commented out line by
  line; includes grouped as the file's own header, `<x.h>`, `<sys/x.h>`, project `"x.h"`, then
  `"test.h"`/`"common.h"`.
  `.clang-format` and `.clang-tidy` (clang 18) are the reference; `tools/vm format` reformats,
  and `tools/check_comments.py` rejects a block comment (`tools/vm format-check` runs it; it
  skips a `/*` inside a string literal, a character literal or a `//` comment). This applies to
  test helpers under `test/` too. Two gaps of clang-tidy 18 are covered by review:
  `bugprone-unused-return-value` takes function names, not patterns (patterns arrive in
  clang-tidy 19), so `.clang-tidy` lists the C library and POSIX functions and the project's own
  functions are unchecked; and `readability-magic-numbers` skips macro arguments, so
  `TEST(name, { ... })` bodies are unchecked. The bootstrap must also stay transliterable into
  fort: no unions, no macro tricks, and no compiler builtin fort lacks (function-pointer tables
  are fine, the bootstrap subset has function pointers). `__builtin_add_overflow` and
  `__builtin_mul_overflow` are the exception the exact constant folder needs; the port replaces
  their three sites in `src/bootstrap/consts.c` by pre-checks, `am > UINT64_MAX - bm` in
  `add_raw`, `a.mag != 0 && b.mag > UINT64_MAX / a.mag` in `cv_mul` and `a.mag == UINT64_MAX` in
  `cv_not`, so no new builtin may be added without the same note. `__builtin_clzll` was removed
  for that reason: `mag > (UINT64_MAX >> n)` says the same thing.
- **fort sources**: identifier conventions per decision D1.4: everything is lower_case with
  underscores, struct and enum type names and enum members included; only module constants are
  UPPER_CASE. A variable never takes its type's name (`point p`, `box bx`, `list mut* mut l`); a
  field may (`node mut* own node`), since fields are not variables and are outside the module
  namespace (D7.9).
- **Shell scripts**: bash with `set -eu`, clean under shellcheck at its default severity; the
  host has no shellcheck, run it in the guest: `tools/vm run 'shellcheck tools/vm
  tools/provision.sh'`.
- **Commit messages**: a title of about 50 characters (72 at most), a blank line, then a body
  wrapped at 72 columns that says what changed and why, then a single `Co-Authored-By:` trailer.
  No `Claude-Session:` trailer: the session URL is useless to anyone reading the history later
  and it is the only line in a commit that no reader can act on.

## Mandatory Process Rules
The following rules MUST be followed by each process/agent for each change being made. There are no
exceptions.

### Lifecycle of a Change
#### Codebase Exploration
Each process/agent MUST explore the relevant portions of the codebase as indicated by the task at
hand.

#### Worktree Isolation
Each Claude process/agent MUST work in a separate git worktree and associated branch. Create the
worktree as a directory (`fort-<name>`) in `.worktrees`, and prefix the branch name with `bug/`,
`feat/`, etc. as you see appropriate. The coordinator deletes the worktree once the change is merged
into the target branch.

#### Change Implementation Loop
Always implement a change in small incremental commits. A commit MUST be composed of a
self-contained unit of logic that improves the overall system. No commit MUST break _any_ test in
the repository. Before committing a change to `git`, make sure all tests pertinent to the component
you are working on run successfully, and make sure that the code format and lint checks pass. Rebase
on top of `main` frequently to reduce the chances of merge conflicts.

Once done with a change that is a single unit of work, squash all commits on the branch into one
via interactive rebase (`git rebase -i origin/main`, mark all but the first as `squash`). Write a
meaningful commit message that describes _what_ and _why_ -- do not just collate the individual
commit messages. Agents that cannot run an interactive rebase use the equivalent
`git reset --soft $(git merge-base main HEAD) && git commit` (not `git reset --soft main`:
if `main` moved since the branch was cut, that commits the branch's old tree on top of the
new `main` and silently reverts its newer commits). A feature branch made of several
self-contained units of work (for example the language design, or a compiler pass plus its tests
plus its documentation) keeps its individual commits and is merged into `main` with a merge commit
(`git merge --no-ff`) whose message describes the whole feature. Until a remote exists, `main`
plays the role of `origin/main`. Worktrees live in `.worktrees/`, which is gitignored.

### Tickets
- One markdown ticket per deliverable in `.tickets/` in the main checkout, never in a worktree;
  state is the directory: `todo/`, `inprogress/`, `done/`. Template and numbering rule in
  `.tickets/README.md`; fields: id, title, size, critical-path, depends-on, impl, review,
  deliverable, spec, branch, worktree, assignee, acceptance criteria (checkboxes), notes, log.
- A ticket is assigned only when every ticket in its `depends-on` is in `done/`. Independent
  tickets are assigned concurrently, one implementor each.
- Acceptance criteria are verifiable inside the VM; the log records every hand-off with its
  evidence (commands run, results, review rounds, merge sha).
- Every ticket meets the 3:1 test-to-code ratio on its own diff, not on the repository average:
  `tools/vm run 'python3 tools/lines.py --since main --min 3.0'` is an acceptance criterion of every
  ticket that adds compiler lines, and the implementor runs it before the gate. The repository ratio
  drifted from 3.34 to 2.50 over six tickets while every one of them passed, because a large corpus
  hides a thin diff; a ticket that cannot reach 3:1 says so in its log with the reason rather than
  lowering the number.
- The ratio is a prompt, not a verdict: what a review asks is which rules of the decisions a ticket
  cites have no test at all, unit or language, and the answer decides the ticket. T-014 measured
  0.76 and merged, because the number could not see that it took 57 entries out of xfail.txt -- a
  body of language tests that already existed and only then began to exercise the code, adding not a
  line to the diff -- while the coverage question found three rules that were untested and also
  broken (a noreturn function type that never matched, an unchecked shift count that made the two
  build modes disagree, and an index expression that handed out a pointer into a dead temporary).
  Ask a reviewer for the list of untested rules whenever a ticket misses the ratio, and merge or
  refuse on that list.

### Agents
- The coordinator is the main session. Every other role is an agent definition in
  `.claude/agents/`, all on Opus and differing only in reasoning effort, because effort is fixed
  per definition and cannot be overridden per call.
- Implementors (full tools, no `Agent` tool): `impl-mech` (medium) for work the specification
  pins completely, transcription and coverage; `impl-std` (high) for ordinary tickets that need
  data-structure design; `impl-hard` (xhigh) for cross-cutting invariants, the calling
  convention, memory layout, ownership and codegen; `impl-port` (medium) for transliterating a
  tested C module into fort against an oracle.
- Reviewers (read-only, the `code-review` skill): `rev-quick` (medium, skill at low) screens a
  low-risk diff for conventions, tests and scope; `rev-std` (high, skill at high) reviews an
  ordinary change; `rev-deep` (xhigh, skill at max) re-derives the invariants independently for
  ABI, memory, ownership, exact arithmetic, unsafe casts and generated code.
- Each ticket names its tiers in its `impl:` and `review:` fields. Review depth follows the risk
  of the change, not the effort it took to write: a ticket can be `impl-std` and `rev-deep`.
- A tier is a default, not a verdict. If a ticket run at `impl-mech` or `impl-port` fails the
  gate twice or comes back with a must-fix finding, the coordinator re-runs it one tier up and
  records the promotion in the ticket log; two promotions out of one tier means the mapping is
  wrong, so change the tickets' `impl:` field rather than promoting case by case.
- Agent definitions in `.claude/agents/` are loaded when a session starts; restart the session
  after adding or changing one.

### Review Workflow
- Coordinator: picks a ticket whose dependencies are done, creates the worktree and branch
  (`.worktrees/fort-<id>`, `feat/<id>-<slug>`), fills branch/worktree/assignee, moves the ticket
  to `inprogress/`, spawns the implementor tier the ticket's `impl:` field names, with the ticket
  path and the worktree.
- Implementor: reads the ticket and only the specification sections it cites; codes and tests in
  the worktree with small commits, each green under `tools/vm check`; runs the full `tools/vm
  gate` once, at the end; squashes if the ticket is a single unit of work; ticks every criterion
  with its evidence; moves the ticket to `done/`; reports in at most 40 lines. It does not spawn
  a reviewer.
- Coordinator: spawns the reviewer tier the ticket's `review:` field names (raising it when the
  diff turned out riskier than the ticket looked), and relays the findings to the implementor,
  which fixes or explicitly declines each one in the ticket log. A second review round happens
  only when the fixes changed behaviour.
- Reviewer: read-only; runs the `code-review` skill on the branch against `main` at its tier's
  effort; also checks spec citations, tests added, `xfail.txt` updates, AGENTS.md updates and
  commit hygiene; returns findings with file:line and severity; never edits, commits or merges.
- Coordinator: re-runs the gate on the branch, merges per the Change Implementation Loop
  (squash for a single unit, `--no-ff` for a multi-unit feature), deletes the worktree and
  branch, appends the merge sha and the agents' token counts to the ticket log, and assigns the
  tickets it unblocked.

### Self-Updating Context (AGENTS.md Auto-Amendment)
AGENTS.md MUST be amended whenever a learning or course correction occurs. This applies in two
cases:
- **Autonomous**: When any process/agent discovers something important during development (e.g., a
  new convention, a gotcha, a pattern that works or fails), they MUST update the relevant section of
  AGENTS.md.
- **User-directed**: When the user gives an instruction that changes how the project works (e.g.,
  new tooling, changed workflow, updated conventions), the receiving agent MUST update AGENTS.md to
  reflect the change immediately.
